## Key Results Summary

- **Total ASVs**: 211
- **Novel Candidates**: 211
- **High-Priority Novel**: 0

## Usage Instructions

1. **View Results**: Open `visualizations/interactive_dashboard.html` in a web browser
2. **Novel Sequences**: Use `sequences/novel_candidates_priority.fasta` for BLAST searches or phylogenetic analysis
3. **Data Analysis**: Import tables from `data_tables/` into R, Python, or Excel for further analysis
4. **Detailed Report**: Read `reports/final_analysis_report.md` for comprehensive findings

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Validation**: BLAST search novel candidates against updated databases (NCBI, SILVA, PR2)
2. **Phylogenetic Analysis**: Use novel_candidates_priority.fasta for detailed phylogenetic placement
3. **Targeted Sequencing**: Design specific primers for abundant novel taxa
4. **Literature Review**: Compare findings with published eDNA studies from similar environments
5. **Database Submission**: Consider submitting novel sequences to public databases after validation

## Files Generated by Analysis Pipeline

This package contains the essential results from a comprehensive eDNA analysis pipeline that included:
- Quality control and preprocessing
- DADA2 ASV inference
- k-mer feature extraction
- Taxonomic assignment via similarity matching
- Clustering and novelty detection
- Ecological diversity analysis
- Phylogenetic placement (if applicable)

For questions about methodology or detailed parameters used, refer to the analysis scripts and logs.
